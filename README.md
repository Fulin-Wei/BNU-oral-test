## GMO（转基因）

（转基因食品优点）When people talk about （GMO）genetically modified food, the first thing that comes to mind is gm food, and many people reject genetically modified food because they think it is potentially harmful.However, in my opinion, genetically modified food has many advantages. First, to solve the food shortage problem, there are still many places in the world that are affected by hunger, so it is necessary to make genetically modified food.Second, genetically modified food reduces the use of pesticides and reduces environmental pollution.The third genetically modified food increases food nutrition and increases the added value.Fourthly, it is necessary to increase the variety of food and improve the quality of food, so even though there are unknown risks, it is necessary.

当人们谈及转基因，最先想到的是转基因食品，许多人拒绝转基因食品因为他们觉得它有潜在的危害。但是在我看来，转基因食品有许多优点，第一.解决粮食短缺问题，目前，全球仍有许多地方受饥饿的影响，所以转基因食品是必要的；第二转基因食品在生长过程中减少了对农药使用，减少了环境污染，；第三转基因食品增加了食物营养，提高附加价值；第四通过转基因增加食物种类，提升食物品质等，所以尽管其存在着未知的风险，但还是必要的。

## Consumerism（消费主义）

定义Consumerism refers to a way of life: the purpose of consumption is not to satisfy the actual needs, but to pursue the satisfaction of the desire to be created and stimulated. Consumerism, in my opinion, there are many shortcomings, first this way of consumption caused the waste of limited resources, people buy things they don't need, that is waste of money and resources, and take up space. in the second place, this way of life make people increase the competition and desire, a lot of people buy something to have no practical value without considering their own economic strength, which caused serious economic burden.So I don't agree with that.

消费主义指的是一种生活方式:消费的目的不是为了实际需求的满足，而是不断追求被制造出来、被刺激起来的欲望的满足。

Reasonable, economic, and necessary of consumption concept(我认为正确的消费观念)

## Plastic surgery（整形手术）

优点Nowadays, plastic surgery is becoming more and more popular in young people. Especially girls. People have changed their appearance through plastic surgery to make themselves more beautiful and more confident. For example, a person may lack confidence because of his appearance, but he changes her appearance through plastic surgery to make herself beautiful.At the same time, she is full of confidence and makes friends widely. She has found a satisfying job with her boyfriend.Therefore, through plastic surgery to change their appearance to the cause and love has a certain auxiliary role.

当今社会，整形越来越流行，人们通过整形手术改变自己的外形目的是使自己变得更漂亮，更有自信。例如一个人可能因为外形的缺点导致他缺乏自信，不敢与人交往，但是他通过整形手术改变自己的外形，使自己变漂亮。同时充满了自信，广泛交朋友，她交到了男朋友还找到了一份满意的工作。所以通过整形手术改变自己的外形对事业和爱情有一定的辅助作用

缺点Nowadays, plastic surgery is becoming more and more popular in young people. Especially girls .People have changed their appearance through plastic surgery to make themselves more beautiful and more confident.However, in my opinion, the risk of plastic surgery is also nots allow to ignore, first of all, plastic surgery is a big spending, on the basis of no economic ability we need to find their parents for money, increase the burden of home.Second, there may be unpredictable risks in the operation.Third, the recovery period may be caused by mood, diet, sudden events leading to a bad recovery, leaving a hangover.Therefore, I suggest that you should be careful about plastic surgery, so that it is important to preserve the beauty of nature.

当今社会，整形越来越流行，人们通过整形手术改变自己的外形目的是使自己变得更漂亮，更有自信。但是在我看来，整形手术的风险也是不容忽视的，第一，整形手术是一笔不小的花费，在没有经济能力的基础上我们需要找父母要钱，增加家里的负担。第二，手术过程中可能出现不可预知的危险。第三，手术恢复期可能由于心情、饮食、突发事件导致恢复不佳，留下后遗症。所以我建议大家要谨慎整形，保持自然的美才重要。

## Integration（一体化）

Nowadays, integration is becoming more and more common, such as integrated project management, integrated design, electromechanical integration technology 、logistics integration and so on.Why integrate?The reasons are the following: the first integration can make the management more convenient, it transforms single management into the management of the whole in order to save time and convenience of management, the second integration can make the benefit maximization, as the saying goes “ 1 plus 1 greater than 2, it show that the integration of benefit than individual benefit.To sum up, the integration of the whole world will become more and more common.

当今社会，一体化越来越普遍，比如、一体化项目管理、一体化设计、机电一体化技术、物流一体化。为什么要实行一体化呢？原因有以下几点：第一一体化可以使管理更加方便，它将对单个部分的管理转变为对整体的管理，节约时间，便于管理，第二一体化可以使利益最大化，有具俗语是1加1大于2，就是说明一体化的利益大于单个的利益。综上所述，全世界范围内的一体化将越来越普遍。

## Package tour（包办旅游即跟团游）

(优点)Contracted tourism refers to a travel that is fully planned and arranged at a fixed price by the company. It includes travel, accommodation, meals, etc.This form of travel is convenient and economical for most young people.Arranged travel is very provincial time and energy, people can leave out the route, fixed accommodation and other things, saving the preparation time in the early period of tourism.Package tour is also cheaper, for most young people, they do not have enough money, so it is more appropriate to choose a package tour.So I think package tour is a good way to travel.

承包旅游指的是一个完全由（旅游）公司计划好的并以以固定价格包办的旅游，它包括了出行，住宿，膳食等。这种旅游形式对于大多数年轻人来说是便利的、省钱的。包办旅游是非常省时间和精力的，人们可以省去查路线、定住宿等事情，节省了旅游前期的准备时间。包办旅游也是比较省钱的，对于大多数年轻人来说，他们并没有充足的钱，所以选择包办旅游更加合适。所以我认为包办旅游是一种很好的旅游方式

## Mercy killing（安乐死）

Mercy killing refers to the cessation of treatment or use of drugs for patients who cannot be treated, so that patients die without pain.At present, there are a lot of controversy about Mercy killing， and I am in favor of Mercy killing.The reasons are the following: 1: in the case of knowing irrecoverable, Mercy killing can reduce the patient's physical and mental pain,and 2 Mercy killing can reduce the waste of resources, and can use the limited resources more where it is needed.however, the Mercy killing is must under the condition of the patients agree to.

安乐死(Euthanasia)指对无法救治的病人停止治疗或使用药物，让病人无痛苦地死去。当前，对安乐死的争议很多，我是比较支持安乐死的。原因有以下几点：一：在明知道无法救治的情况下，安乐死可以减少病人的身体以及心理疼痛，二安乐死可以减少资源浪费，可以把有限的资源用到更加需要的地方，但是安乐死还是必须在病人自己同意的情况下才可以的。

## Talent show（选秀节目）

（优点同原因）Nowadays, talent shows are becoming more and more popular.There are more and more kinds of talent shows, such as The Voice of China and Sing My Song.I like watching it, too.Why do people like this kind of program? First talent show can help people to make them dream come true, for many ordinary people, they can through talent shows show their talent, the purpose is the opportunity to gain fame and money, and changed their lives.Secondly, the talent show is an entertainment program. When people are tired or in a bad mood, they can get happiness by watching the shows. These are the reasons for the popularity of the show, and also the advantage of the talent show.

## Encourment（鼓励，激励）

1. I think as a human being, one can hardly do without a friend, for life without friends will be a lonely voyage in the vast dark sea or one in the barren desert. 我认为作为一个人，没有朋友是很难做到的，因为没有朋友的生活将是孤独的航行，在茫茫的大海中，或者在荒芜的沙漠里。
2. a friend gives out light and warmth like a lamp. For this reason, I have always felt it a blessing if a friend comes to console me in my sadness, cheer me up in my low spirits, or heartedly share with me my happiness. 一个朋友散发着光和温暖就像一盏灯。因为这个原因，我一直觉得如果一个朋友来安慰我的悲伤，让我振作起来，或者和我一起分享我的快乐，这是一种幸福。
3. It is wonderful, too, to feel that someone is standing by me and ready to provide help and encouragement in my pursuit of a noble and glorious cause. 感觉有人正站在我身边，准备为我追求崇高而光荣的事业提供帮助和鼓励，这也是美妙的。

## Time management（时间管理，合理安排时间）

There are many choices in life and often-times we re faced with many choices to choose from at the same time. When you practice good time management, you have more time to breathe; this allows you to determine which choices are the best to make.When you feel pressed for time and have to make a decision, you re more likely to jump to conclusions and not fully consider the different options; this leads to poor decision making.

当你练习好时间管理的时候，你有更多的时间去呼吸;这可以让你确定哪些选择是最好的。

Well, speaking from my own experience, I used to be terrible at time management and it meant that I was always doing things at the last minute, or even late - now it's completely different, I manage my time well and it allows me to get more done and with less stress so that's what I think other people would benefit from if they managed their own time better, they would have more time free or be able to do more in the same amount of time.

个人观点，如果更好的管理自己的时间,他们会有更多的时间自由或者能够在相同的时间内做更多的事。

In my extra time I'd probably use it to relax more and maybe do some kind of activity, maybe a sport or something like that to do something different, or learn something new.

在我的额外时间里，我可能会用它来放松，或者做一些活动，也许是一项运动，或者类似的事情来做一些不同的事情，或者学习一些新的东西。

## Medicine（医学）

Medicine is the art and science of healing. It encompasses a range of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore human health by the prevention and treatment of illness. Contemporary medicine applies health science, biomedical research, and medical technology to diagnose and treat injury and disease, typically through medication, surgery, or some other form of therapy.

医学是治疗的艺术和科学。它包括一系列的卫生保健实践，通过预防和治疗疾病来维持和恢复人类的健康。现代医学应用健康科学、生物医学研究和医学技术来诊断和治疗受伤和疾病，特别是通过药物、手术或其他形式的治疗。

There are traditional Chinese medicine and western medicine.Traditional Chinese medicine believes that all parts of the human body are affected by each other, so the traditional Chinese medicine pays more attention to the adjustment of the whole body.The treatment of western medicine is to treat the human body as a machine made up of many parts, so it pays more attention to the regulation of human body part.

有中药和西药。中医认为人体的各个部位都受到彼此的影响，所以中医更注重全身的调整。西医治疗是将人体作为一种由许多部位组成的机器，因此对人体部分的调节更加关注。

Whether traditional Chinese medicine or western medicine, since its birth, the main function is to cure the disease.At the end of the 20th century, the global medical community concluded that the best medicine was not the medicine that cures the disease, but the medicine that makes people not sick.So, we think that the future of medicine should be scientific prevention。

无论是中药还是西药，从其诞生起，主要的功能就是治病。在20世纪末，全球医学界认为最好的药物不是治疗疾病的药物，而是让人们不生病的药物。所以，我们认为医学的未来应该是科学的预防。

Is the nature of the created, food spawned humans, any kind of food in the world have drugs, long-term dietary structure, the partial eclipse is unscientific, unreasonable and unbalanced is all ills, and even death.The world health organization puts forward the four pillars of health: balanced nutrition, moderate exercise, adequate sleep, and smoking cessation.

创造是人类的天性，食物孕育了人类，世界上任何一种食物都有药物，长期的饮食结构，偏食是不科学的，不合理的和不平衡的都是疾病，甚至死亡。世界卫生组织提出了健康的四大支柱:营养均衡、适度运动、充足睡眠和戒烟。

## Monotonous（单调的）

定义Monotonous, single;Repetition and lack of change.There is only one kind or repetition of the lack of change: monotone |, monotonous | monotonous life

Multiculturalism as a political philosophy involves ideologies and policies which vary widely,ranging from the advocacy of equal respect to the various cultures in a society, to policies of promoting the maintenance of cultural diversity

多元文化主义作为一种政治哲学，涉及到各种各样的意识形态和政策，从倡导平等尊重社会的各种文化，到促进文化多样性的维护。

Multiculturalism that promotes maintaining the distinctiveness of multiple cultures is often contrasted to other settlement policies such as social integration, cultural assimilation and racial segregation.

多元文化主义有助于保持多元文化的独特性，这常常与其他的解决政策形成对比，例如社会融合、文化同化和种族隔离。

Good students are foundation of building a top level international university. Without the student loan, some students born in poverty areas may lost the opportunity to study in university. It is really a pity for them. Secondly, thanks to the student loan, many students who have economic difficulties don’t have to do a part time job during the studying period. They can pay more attention to studying knowledge.
What should wo do?
From what has been discussed above, we should call for the government to provide more student loans. What’s more, the whole society should pay more attention to the students who need economic helps. Only in this way can we obtain a hopefully tomorrow.

## Riding A Bike

**What is it?**
Riding a bike is a kind of healthy sport. Many people can ride a bike. Along with the development of economics, the traffic in urban is terrible. So more and more people take bike as an efficient vehicle.

**Benefits of riding a bike.**
As we all know. Riding a bike has many benefits. Firstly, it is a healthy spot. It has many benefits to our heart and lung. Riding a bike regularly not only can make our heart stronger but also can make our lung healthier. Secondly, it is a safe spot. Riding a bike on the bikeway has a very low possibility to be injured. It is a gentle spot not like soccer or basketball. Thirdly, riding a bike is an efficient way to avoid the traffic problems, such as traffic jam. What’s more, riding a bike will not pollute the environment. We should call for more people riding a bike instead of driving a car. Only in this way can we get a blue sky in tomorrow.

**How to get start it?**
As we talked above. Riding a bike has many benefits. There is a problem that how to start riding a bike? Firstly, you should buy a suitable bike. You should choose a smooth path where there are a few people so that you needn’t worry about striking someone else. Everything is ready, you can try to ride a bike with the help of your parents.

## Vegetarian Diet

**What is vegetarian diet?**
Vegetarian diet is the practice of abstaining meat of fish. There are different types of vegetarian. Some consume eggs and dairy products, while the strictest kind, eat no animal produce at all, including honey. Some people call themselves vegetarians, but they consume fish.

It is not necessary to eat meat to get all the nutrients needed for good health. A person who chooses not to eat meat may enjoy better health, because they will eat more plant-based foods, and because they may be more active in making healthy choices.
A vegetarian diet has been found to reduce the risk of heart disease and some types of cancer, leading to a longer life expectancy. It may also lead to weight loss.

About 6 percent of people in the United States describe themselves as vegetarian.

Apart from health considerations, people become vegetarian for a range of reasons. Producing vegetarian food is more ecologically sustainable, and it reduces damage to the environment.

Anyone who is deciding to become a vegetarian needs to educate themselves to ensure they continue to get their key nutrients. Parents of vegetarian children must make sure their child is not just omitting the meat served with the family meal, but getting their nutrients in other ways.

It is possible to become a vegetarian at once, but a gradual change may work better for two reasons. Firstly, a gradual change is more likely to become a lifestyle and a long-term move. Secondly, a sudden dietary change can affect some people’s digestive system at first. Gradually replacing meat with more vegetables, fruits, beans and grains may reduce this impact.

Each coin has its two sides, vegetarian may bring some risks, such as lacking of iron, calcium, vitamins and other nutrients. People who do not eat meat or fish may lack these nutrients, especially if they are not consuming eggs or dairy products.

## Free Healthcare

**What is free healthcare?**
Free healthcare is one kind of social service. It is aim to help the people who cannot afford to the payment of medical treatment.

**Why healthcare is needed?**
Nowadays, the expenses of medical treatment are very high. Not everyone can afford to it. Think about the children who are sick and their parents don’t have enough money to take them to hospital. They buying them medicine which is not working and the child is getting worse. Now they have to take their child to hospital and they are facing more stress to the treatment. What’s wrong with their child to suffer all of these?

If someone has cancer, the treatments are very costly. It is a common sense that a someone’s life is more valuable than money. So the government and society should do something to help people in sick. The government should offer free healthcare to everyone, especially to the poor, the old and the young.

Taking my grandfather as an example, about 10 years ago, my grandfather refused to go to the hospital because he didn’t have enough money to pay the bills. He just stay at home and suffering the sick until it is too late to save him. I really feel so bad about my grandfather.

**What should we do?**
From what has been discussed above, free healthcare is necessary and important. We should call for the government and society offer free healthcare. Health problem is associated to everyone including you and me. So, we should pay more attention to the revolution of healthcare. Only in this way can we realize the equity to everyone’s life.

## Reading

**What is reading?**
It’s generally believed that reading is an important part of our life. It undoubtedly enriches our life. When we fell lonesome, we can pick up a book and enjoy what we read. As the development of the world there is more and more entertainment for people to kill time. Reading is still important. The reasons are flowing. By reading, we may feel we are living different kinds of lives, and talking to people of different periods in history. Besides, by reading, we may also feel someone is giving us some good advice in on life and work. Therefore, reading is really indispensable to our life.

**How to be a good reader?**
But how to be a good reader? In my opinion, to be good readers, we should take at least three factors into account. First, one should read extensively. No doubt, the more books one reads, the more is inclined to read. Besides, a good reader should always read some books actively rather than passively, because reading is viewed as a kind of effective intercourse with the writer. Finally, a good reader should always ponder upon what he reads, for reading without thinking is like eating without digestion. All in all, from reading comes understanding; and from understanding comes more reading.

From what has been discussed above, we may reasonably arrive at the conclusion that a good reader is one who not only reads actively and extensively, but also reads with full understanding.

## E-book

What is e-book?
An e-book is an electronic version of a book, typically read on an e-reader. Books have finally made their way to the digital age. The introduction of e-books has completely transformed the way that people read and publish books.

**Pros of e-books**
Here is a look at some of the pros and cons of e-books.

1. Easily readable: because e-books are read using a computer or e-reader, their format is more fluid than traditional books. Readers can alter the size of font or zoom in on specific sections.
2. Cost effective: these days, newly released print books can cost 30 or more. Companies such as Amazon and Dangdang make e-books available at a much cheaper rate. This is because the reader is not paying for the printing and shipping cost that associated with the traditional books.
3. Mobility: Readers can easily carry hundreds of e-books. This is ideal for people who travel often. Rather than picking just on book to bring along, readers can choose from a variety of e-books.
4. Environmentally Friendly: The e-books has reduced the number of pages that are actually being printed. E-books are environmentally friendly because they do not require paper or ink.

**Cons of e-books**
While e-books have many advantages, they also have a number of drawbacks.

Piracy: the sharing of files become very easy when they are in electronic form. Therefore, people who have not paid for e-books are still getting a hold of them. This is unfair to authors and publishers.
Because e-books are a relatively new medium, their future is uncertain. If you are writing a book, plan to hire a ghostwriter or are considering self-publishing, it is important to follow the trends of e-books. This will help you stay informed about your best options when it comes to publishing.

## International Aid for Developing Country

**What is International Aid?**
International aid is assistance provided to foreign nations in need. Most countries around the world have formal international aid programs in their governments, and in addition, service are provided by private organizations all over the world. The aid around the world is critical for many struggling nations and developing countries. Even many strong countries can occasionally benefit from the international assistance.

**Different kinds of international aid.**
This assistance can take a number of forms. Some aid programs focus on providing money in the form of loans. Monetary assistance can be especially beneficial for developing nations. They may be struggling with debt obligations and they need to fund major infrastructure projects which will improve quality of life in the long term.

Aid can also come in the form of donated goods such as food, electronic equipment and other facilities. This kind of assistance can be especially beneficial for the counties which are suffering disasters, such as earthquake or flood.

Services are also an important part of most international aid programs. In developing countries, the services of professional such as doctors, engineers and architects can make a substantial difference in the lives of residents. Professional services can improve the quality of life for the population, and eventually make it possible for nations to develop their own professional classes by sending people abroad for study.

**The importance of international aid.**
From what has been discussed above, we may reasonably arrive at the conclusion that the international assistance is important to each country. Though providing international aid may cost a lot of money, many nations also do that actively. International aid fosters international cooperation and strengthens the ties between nations all over the world.

## Living in another Country

Along with the rapid growth of economics and globalizations. Many people have opportunity to living in another country. Some people living abroad for studying and some for working and some for travelling.

In my opinion, living abroad is really a good opportunity for people to gain a lot of useful experiences and valuable knowledge. There are many advantages to spending time living in another country. However, living abroad can also be a hard experience. People who lived away from their countries usually face some effect.

Living abroad is a tempting opportunity for people that could lead to gain a lot of useful experiences and valuable knowledge. However, living in a foreign country can be an experience both happy and hard. At the same time, it would be new experience and memorable days. People who lived away from their countries usually face some effect, I will mention three most common effects of living in a foreign country that can change people’s lives.
The major effect, and also a very common one, is missing anything that reminding you of both your family and hometown. Living away from your family sometimes makes you feel homesick. You will realize how valuable your family is.

The second main effect is acquiring the knowledge to how accept culture and traditions of foreign societies. Living abroad would be an opportunity to develop your opinion for societies and accepting different opinions that will make you be able to achieve the truth knowledge.

The third and perhaps most important effect is personal development and learning a new language. Living away from home, makes you more confident and independent. You have to do everything and solve your problem by yourself.

## Online Course

Online course is a new teaching method based on computer and internet. This special type of education makes the teachers possible to teach from a long distance away. It also makes it possible that students all over the world can take part in one class at the same time.
It is becoming more and more popular in colleges and universities, and acts as an effective complement to traditional teaching. However, opinions on it differ from teachers to students.

Generally, teachers support it for two reasons.

Firstly, it is convenient to join an online course. No matter you are at home or at office, you can take part in the online course by computer and internet. In this way, you can save a lot of time because you don’t have to waste time on the way to traditional class.
Secondly, online course releases teachers from repeating the same contents. Because the video can be played again and again. Students can watch the video repeatedly if the class is not easy to understand.  

However, many students have opposite standpoints:

Firstly, with online course, they lack face-to-face communications with teachers and classmates. Communication is an important part of learning knowledge. Students’ confusion cannot be solved instantly. It will do harm to the effect of learning.

Secondly, the computer system cannot be guaranteed to stably all the time. Consider a case when you are paying attention to the online class, the computer system crashed. The thinking may be interrupted.

What’ more, students do not have 100percent confidence in their self-discipline without teachers being around. The teacher in traditional class can supervise the students to study hard.

Personally, with the college students growing up, if the traditional teaching method and the modern ones like on-line courses can be combined together, the education can be more effective. Students can learn knowledge more convenient. Everyone can learn in everywhere.

## Zoos and animals

Along with repaid growth of economics and urbanization. There are not many people in world who haven’t visited a zoo in their lifetime. The trip of visiting a zoo is funny and excited. It is a chance for us to see animals that we may never see again in our lifetime. Nowadays more and more zoos have been established to keep animals on the edge of extinction Some think that zoos have a chance to observe. However, I believe that keeping animals in cages is absolutely wrong. There are three reasons to support my opinion.

To begin with, I firmly think animals will lose their natural wildness. The best example is a giant panda’s story. The panda saving center released a giant panda. Months later, it’s dead because of its breaking into a wild panda’s zone and fighting. So I think that animals growing at zoos can hardly survive in nature.

Moreover, people don’t have right to put animals in cages even it may help us to protect the animals. We don’t have the right to do so. We can always see animals in cages turning around again and again, it is obvious that they are annoying. What if put human beings into cages and let animals see them outsides? It totally disobeys basic morality to send animals in cages.

Last but not least. Putting animals in zoos breaking the eco-system. As we all know, nature can rearrange the system perfectly by itself. If one kind of animals are no longer fit to live, they will die out. Stopping it with personal decision is not good eco-system.

In the final analysis, even though zoos treat animals very well, I insist on that it is cruel to animals. Nobody has the right to imprison anyone including animals. Tigers, pandas, deers and so on, they are not treated on the fair way.

## Watching movie at home or in cinemas

Watching movie is an amazing form of entertainment to relax for many people nowadays. After a hard-working day, nothing can be more comfortable than watching films. Some people prefer to watch movie at home rather than watch movie in cinemas, but some hold the opposite view.

The people who prefer to watch movie at home hold the following reasons. Firstly, watching movie at home is comfortable. The repaid development of home theater as well as the internet makes it possible to enjoy movie we like without stepping out our room. We can save a lot of transporting time on the way. Once we would like to watch a movie, just turn on the power, then find a comfortable way, whether sitting or lying is ok, which is impossible in cinema. Secondly, watching movie at home will make us enjoy more freedom. You can eat, and are able to talk to each other about the film. These are impossible in such a public place like cinema. The most important thing. If you watch movie at home, the price of the tickets will never bother you again.

The people who prefer to watch movie at cinema hold the following reasons. One of the biggest factors is the bigger screen and realer sound which are far better than home DVD players. A second factor that makes people attached to cinema is that it offers people an opportunity to go outside home and develop social activities. People usually invite their lovers, families, or friends to see a movie together. This will certainly increase the interactivity among people. It is a good chance for us to establish and maintain relationships.

In my opinion, watching movies in cinema is preferred than watching them at home because of the above reasons. Today, cinemas are trying to improve the standard of their films, many technologies are developed to make the film viewer feel as real as possible. The feeling of watching movies in cinema is better and better.

## Tax an income

Almost every government around the world now takes money from its citizens as tax. With such money, they are able to improve the constructions within the country and more importantly, they could develop education, medical and welfare system. It seems that everyone benefits from it.

However, not everyone considers such tax system a reasonable one. Many argue that they are pressured by tax, especially in the developed countries where the tax rates are very high. For example, it is quite common in such countries that the amount of the tax collected from the husband’s income is as much as the wife’s total income. I believe most wife would rather choose to stay at home there is no income tax which is so high.

On the other side, most people support the tax system, no matter how much tax he pays each year. Just like what I mentioned above, with the tax money, the government could do a great number of things which will benefit them. Without such money, how can the roads, schools and hospitals be constructed and how could we travel, receive education and treatment? Though the tax rates are somewhat high in some areas, still there are many citizens who willing to pay.

As to myself, I agree with the latter. No one could deny the benefit he has gained from the programs built with the tax money. And I believe that with more money, the government could offer us better welfare conditions and everyone could be able to enjoy a better life as a result. Besides, it is a useful way to help poor.

## Learning English at a young age

With the increasing social competition, people pay more and more attention on young generation. Especially their parents will take every means to help their children get prepared for adapting the society. Thus, learning English in a very young age becomes very common among little children. Some people agree with it, but some hold the opposite view.

The people who suggest children should learn English at a young age have the following reasons. Firstly, English is nowadays the main language for business at a global level, which is why people all around the world believe English is one of the best language to learn. Secondly, studies suggest that children learning an additional language are more creative, better at solving complex problems and usually score higher on standard tests. Thirdly, learning English helps children to better understand other cultures. This can encourage children to explore the world actively.

However, there are some opposite opinions. To begin with, children in a young age should live happily, instead of gaining burden. Childhood plays a very important role in one’s whole life. A child having a happy childhood may be a sunshine boy, when he grows up. Secondly, according to the present situation, learning English is very significant, but leaning Chinese is also couldn’t ignore. If a person can’t learn his mother language well, how can he make others believe he can learn other things well. So, it isn’t need to lean a second language in a hurry.

In my opinion, it is an obvious fact that the more year learning English and the more use of it made, the greater that will be achieved.

## Hacked and illegal download

When a movie or song is produced and marked, everyone involved in the process has monetary gains from the sale of that product. Therefore, that product is protected by copyright law so that it cannot be copied, reproduced or resold without their permission.
